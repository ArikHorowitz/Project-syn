Synthia: A Crucible for Thought

Synthia is a bespoke, local-first digital environment for building and connecting ideas. It's a focused tool for researchers, thinkers, and writers who want to construct robust arguments from a web of atomic notes and their verifiable sources.

Core Philosophy

Synthia is built on three core principles that define its workflow:

Fragment-First Thinking: The fundamental unit of knowledge is the Fragmentâ€”a small, atomic, and titled note. Instead of large, monolithic documents, Synthia encourages you to break down your thoughts into their most essential, linkable components.

Rigorous Citation: Knowledge is a network of evidence. Synthia allows you to build a personal library of bibliographic Sources (books, articles, etc.). Every Fragment you write can be directly linked to its parent Source, creating an explicit, traceable connection between your ideas and your research.

Local-First & Data Sovereignty: Your work is yours, permanently. All data is stored directly on your machine. There are no clouds, no subscriptions, and no servers. You can export your entire workspace at any time, guaranteeing you always own your intellectual property.

Key Features

Fragment-Centric Workspace: Your primary workspace is a clean, searchable list of all your Fragments. The entire UI is optimized for quickly creating, finding, and editing these atomic notes.

Source Archive: A dedicated view for ingesting and managing your Sources. Build a personal, structured bibliography that serves as the evidentiary foundation for your work.

Direct Source Linking: Use the Inspector to instantly link a Fragment to any Source in your archive. This creates a powerful, two-way connection between your thoughts and the material that inspired them.

Metadata Inspector: A focused panel for managing the currently active Fragment's metadata. Instantly edit its title, manage its tags, and connect it to a Source.

Powerful Command Palette (Cmd+K): A fast, keyboard-driven interface to access almost every action in the application without leaving your flow state.

Global Search: Instantly find any text across the titles and content of all your Fragments.

Local History & Snapshots: Create named snapshots of your entire workspace. Experiment and refactor your ideas freely, knowing you can restore a previous version at any time.

Customizable Editor: Adjust the editor's font, size, and line height to create your perfect writing environment.

Data Portability: Export your full workspace for backups, or export individual Fragments to standard formats like Markdown and Plain Text.

The Synthia Workflow

Using Synthia follows a simple, powerful loop for building knowledge:

INGEST: Use the Ingestion view (Database icon) to add a new Source to your archive. This is your evidence.

CREATE: Use the Explorer view (Files icon) to create a new Fragment. This is your idea.

CONNECT: With your Fragment open, use the Inspector (Info icon) to link your new idea back to its Source.

EXPLORE: Use the Explorer and Search views to navigate the web of knowledge you have built. Discover new connections and synthesize new ideas.

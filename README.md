# Synthia - An IDE for Writers

A bespoke, local-first digital environment that seamlessly translates the chaos of creative thought into the clarity of structured narrative.

## Core Philosophy

Synthia is built on three core principles:

1.  **Local-First & Data Sovereignty**: Your work is yours. All data is stored directly on your machine in your browser's local storage. You can export your entire workspace at any time.
2.  **Structured Thinking**: Creative writing is not just about prose; it's about structure. Synthia allows you to organize your manuscript into parts and chapters, and your research into atomic "fragments."
3.  **Frictionless Workflow**: Inspired by modern code editors (IDEs), Synthia provides a powerful, keyboard-driven interface with features like a command palette, split editors, and a distraction-free writing environment.

## Key Features

-   **Structured Editor**: Organize your manuscript into a traditional Table of Contents with Parts and Chapters.
-   **Fragment Library**: A dedicated space for all your atomic notes, ideas, quotes, and research. Keep your unstructured thoughts separate from your manuscript but easily accessible.
-   **Seamless Linking**: Connect your research to your writing. Link fragments to multiple chapters to build a web of connected ideas. Drag-and-drop fragments directly onto chapters to create links instantly.
-   **Powerful Command Palette (`Cmd+K`)**: Access almost every feature in the application without touching your mouse.
-   **Local History & Snapshots**: Create named snapshots of your entire workspace. Experiment freely, knowing you can restore to a previous version at any time.
-   **Global Search**: Instantly find any text across all your chapters and fragments.
-   **Customizable Environment**: Adjust the editor's font, size, and line height to create your perfect writing setup.
-   **Import & Export**: Guarantee your data ownership. Export your full workspace for backups, or export individual documents and the full manuscript to standard formats like Markdown and Plain Text.

## How to Use

-   Use the **Explorer** on the left to manage your manuscript structure.
-   Use the **Fragment Library** in the bottom panel to manage your notes and ideas.
-   Use the **Inspector** on the right to see metadata and linked fragments for the active document.
-   Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the **Command Palette** and explore all available actions.
